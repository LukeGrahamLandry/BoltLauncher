# BoltLauncher Privacy Policy

The official build of BoltLauncher does not transmit any of your data to our servers. 

Metadata servers (where game files are downloaded from) will get your ip address because that's how HTTP works. 
They will also be able to tell which version you're playing by which files are requested. 

The Microsoft identity platform is used to login to your Minecraft account. 
Minecraft has telemetry that sends information to Microsoft.
