## Promoted Content 

I'll never include traditional algorithmic banner ads that take up half the screen. However, I'd consider native placement of relevant content that players might be interested in. 

Server owners might be interested in having their server IP automatically added to the in game server list whenever a profile of a compatible mod pack is created. I don't think this would be particularly intrusive for players since they could just remove the entry in a single click if they're not interested. Since it would just be added to the servers menu there'd be no intrusion on other game and launcher usage.  

Modpack owners might be interested in having their pack appear in the profiles list (where players could delete it if not interested) or featured on the initial search page. I'd never have it automatically download anything as that seems disrespectful to players' disk space but just giving a one click install option to people already looking for something to play seems reasonable. 

Server hosting companies might be interested in a tasteful link in the sidebar. I could also implement your api to allow players to create a server of a given mod pack in one click from within the launcher.
