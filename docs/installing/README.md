# How Minecraft Installers Work

Before you can launch the game you have to download the right files and put them in the right places. There are extra steps depending which mod loader you want to use.

- [Vanilla (no modloader)](game/vanilla.md)
- [Fabric (or Quilt)](game/fabric.md)
- [Forge](game/forge.md)

Whatever you choose, Minecraft also requires the [Java Runtime Environment](java.md) before the game can start. 

Mods can be installed by just downloading their jar files to the `mods` folder of an instance before starting the game. Different mod distribution sites have thier own apis and there are a variety of formats for modpacks.

- [Curseforge](curseforge.md) 
- [Modrinth](modrinth.md)
