Over time, the launcher will have updates to its own code and it would be annoying for players to have to redownload it from a website every time. We'll want an easy way to detect and install available updates. Like the rest of our code downloading features, players are able to disable this feature if they don't trust the update server. 

Tje automatic updating system supports several standard formats for determining when a new update is available. These all provide a way to give a url to a list of versions that have a download url associated with them. 

- [Github Releases](github-releases.md)
- [Appcasts (like Sparkle's format)](appcasts.md)
- [Squirrel's format](squirrel.md)

Apps for MacOS will proably need to be signed.
